# Surface Framework  
## Canvas GUI  

Yes it's my same old poker-dice game you've all seen on many platforms.    
Now, its back on my newly updated Surface framework!

Once again:
  - Only two files -- index.html + a vannilla JS bundle
  - One DOM element
  - Ultra-fine-grained reactivity!
  - Zero dependencies -- none - nada

## Usage:
```
Click the 'Roll Button' to start.    
After each roll of the dice, you can 'click' a die to 'freeze' its value.    
Click again to toggle the frozen state. When frozen, value will be held!
After three rolls, you must select a score item.  
The blue highlighted numbers indicate possible scores that are available to select.
Have fun!
```
## NOTE: Try it now!
